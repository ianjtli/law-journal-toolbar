# Artemis Law Journal Proofreading Toolbar
A Microsoft Word toolbar for proofreading and fixing common errors in law journal publications.

# Functions
The toolbar contains tools to check for and fix (1) journal name abbreviation errors or journal name small caps errors, (2) missing supra/infra cross-reference links, (3) missing permalinks or active hyperlinks, (4) non-italicized introductory signals, (5) missing periods at the end of footnotes, and (6) case name abbreviation errors.

Note that the toolbar may identify false positives or fail to identify true positives. The user can review each error in the GUI and decide whether to fix it.
